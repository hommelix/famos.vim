famos.vim
=========

A Vim plugin for editing imc FAMOS Sequence files, providing mainly syntax highlighting

The currently edited script can be launched using ``<F7>``. If imc FAMOS is not installed in the typical location, its location can be customized by setting g:famos_exe in your .vimrc file. By default it is 
```viml
let g:famos_exe = "C:/Program Files/imc/imc Famos/Bin/Famos.exe"
```

Future plan
===========
[ ] Add jumping to file on a Sequence line using ``<Ctrl> + ]``
